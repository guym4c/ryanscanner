Attempting to take advantage of European point-to-point airline network structures at HackUPC.

This is an extremely hacked-together project - abandon hope all ye who enter - and in the end, due to limitations in SkyScanner's API, it didn't work. But I enjoyed building it a lot. Props to the team at HackUPC!
